        questions={[
          {
            question: "How does the 'Valid Palindrome' problem define a palindrome?",
            options: ["Reads the same forward and backward, including symbols", "Reads the same forward and backward after removing non-alphanumeric characters and ignoring case", "Any word that has at least two of the same letter", "A string with an even number of characters"],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "In most coding challenges, palindromes are case-insensitive and ignore non-alphanumeric characters like spaces or punctuation."
          },
          {
            question: "Which of these is the most memory-efficient way to check for a palindrome?",
            options: ["Reversing the entire string and comparing", "Using two pointers (left and right) and comparing inward", "Splitting the string into an array and sorting", "Converting the string into a number"],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "The two-pointer approach uses O(1) auxiliary space because it doesn't create a new copy of the string."
          },
          {
            question: "What should 'isPalindrome('')' (empty string) return based on LeetCode standards?",
            options: ["True", "False", "Null", "Error"],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "An empty string is considered a valid palindrome as it reads the same forward and backward by vacuously satisfying the condition."
          },
          {
            question: "Why do we convert the string to lowercase before checking?",
            options: ["To save memory", "To make it case-insensitive ('A' and 'a' should match)", "Because lowercase characters are faster to process", "It is mandatory for all LeetCode problems"],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "Palindromes are usually about the sequence of letters, not their capitalization."
          },
          {
            question: "In the string 'A man, a plan, a canal: Panama', what is the first letter compared with the last letter (after cleaning)?",
            options: ["'A' and 'a'", "'A' and '.'", "'m' and 'a'", "'A' and 'P'"],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "After cleaning and lowercasing, the first char is 'a' and the last is 'a' (from Panama), hence they match."
