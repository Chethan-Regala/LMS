        <p>Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the LeetCode milestone.</p>
        <p>Here's your quick, simple guide for this milestone.</p>
        <p>The goal is to help you grow your coding skills and your online tech presence, all through one small activity.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>What You'll Do (and Why It Helps You)</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Solve one LeetCode problem</h4>
        <p>Because real problem-solving builds confidence and strengthens your logic over time — even one problem makes a difference.</p>

        <h4>2. Take a screenshot of your Accepted solution</h4>
        <p>Just a quick way for us to confirm you've completed the milestone.</p>

        <h4>3. Use the LeetHub extension to auto-push your solution to GitHub [Optional]</h4>
        <p>This keeps your GitHub active without any extra effort. A greener GitHub = stronger portfolio = better impression during internships and placements.</p>

        <h4>4. (Optional) Share your progress on LinkedIn[Optional]</h4>
        <p>A small post shows consistency and helps you build visibility. Recruiters love seeing growth.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>How to Complete It (Simple Steps)</h3>
        
        <h4>Step 1: Open the LeetCode problem</h4>
        <p>Read it slowly, check the examples, and try a simple approach first. You don't need the smartest solution — just the correct one.</p>

        <h4>Step 2: Get the green "Accepted"</h4>
        <p>Once you do, take a quick screenshot.</p>

        <h4>Step 3: Install the LeetHub Chrome extension[Optional]</h4>
        <p>Sign in with GitHub → Let it create a repo → Now every time you solve a problem, your code appears on GitHub automatically. Zero manual work.</p>

        <h4>Step 4: Check your GitHub repository [Optional]</h4>
        <p>Make sure your latest solution is there. If yes — great! You've now added to your portfolio.</p>

        <h4>Step 5: Share on LinkedIn [Optional]</h4>
        <p>A simple post like:</p>
        <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded italic">
          <p>"Solved today's LeetCode milestone and learned &lt;concept&gt;. Loving the auto-push to GitHub via LeetHub!"</p>
        </div>
        <p>This builds your visibility over time.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>Your Submission</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Screenshot of your Accepted LeetCode submission</li>
          <li>GitHub repo link (auto-updated by LeetHub)</li>
          <li>(Optional) LinkedIn post link/screenshot</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="content-section">
        <p>This milestone isn't about perfection. It's about showing up, practicing, and building small habits that compound into something big — stronger skills, a better GitHub, and a more confident you.</p>
        <p>You've got this. 🚀</p>
