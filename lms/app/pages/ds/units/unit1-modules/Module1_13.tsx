            question: "What does 'In-Place' modification mean?",
            options: ["Creating a copy of the array", "Modifying the input data structure directly without extra memory", "Storing the data in a database", "Using a faster CPU"],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "In-place algorithms modify the original input, keeping the Auxiliary Space complexity at O(1)."
          },
          {
            question: "In the Two-Pointer approach to reverse a string of length 'n', at what point do the pointers meet?",
            options: ["At index n", "At index 0", "At index n/2", "They never meet"],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Since the pointers move from both ends toward the center, they will meet or cross halfway through the array."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the Time Complexity of reversing a string with 'n' characters?",
            options: ["O(1)", "O(log n)", "O(n)", "O(n^2)"],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "You visit roughly half the characters to perform swaps, which simplifies to O(n) linear time."
          },
          {
            question: "Which operation is used to switch the values of two variables in an array?",
            options: ["Add", "Shift", "Swap", "Rotate"],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "A swap operation (often using a temporary variable) is Used to exchange values between two memory locations."
          },
          {
            question: "If 'left = 0' and 'right = 4', how many total swaps will occur to reverse the array?",
            options: ["5", "4", "3", "2"],
            correctAnswer: 3,
            explanation: "Index 0 swaps with 4, then 1 swaps with 3. Index 2 (the middle) doesn't need to swap with itself. Total = 2."
