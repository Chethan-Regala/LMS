        <p>
          Welcome to your first pair programming assignment! In this session, we'll use arrays to implement one of the most elegant algorithms in number theory, the <strong>Sieve of Eratosthenes</strong>.

            "This technique isn't just about identifying primes—it's a brilliant example of preprocessing and optimization in algorithm design."

        <h3>The Core Concept</h3>
        <p>Instead of checking every number individually back-to-front, the Sieve works by <strong>elimination</strong>:</p>

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">For every prime found, strike out all of its multiples (e.g., if 2 is prime, strike 4, 6, 8...).</p>

        questions={[
          {
            question: "What is the primary function of the Sieve of Eratosthenes?",
            options: ["To sort an array of numbers", "To find all prime numbers up to a given 'n'", "To find the GCD of two numbers", "To encrypt a string"],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient and efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit 'n'."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the first number we start with when marking multiples in the Sieve?",
            options: ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "We start at 2 because it is the smallest prime number. 0 and 1 are not prime numbers."
          },
          {
            question: "Once we identify 'p' as a prime, which numbers do we mark as 'not prime'?",
            options: ["All numbers after p", "All divisors of p", "All multiples of p (2p, 3p, 4p...)", "None of them"],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "The logic of the sieve is to eliminate all multiples of a prime, as a multiple of a prime is by definition not a prime itself."
          },
          {
            question: "What is the Time Complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes?",
            options: ["O(n)", "O(n^2)", "O(n log log n)", "O(log n)"],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "The Sieve is extremely fast, with a complexity of O(n log log n), making it much faster than checking each number individually."
          },
          {
            question: "What kind of extra memory is typically used to implement the Sieve?",
            options: ["A single integer variable", "A boolean array of size n+1", "A 2D matrix", "No extra memory is needed"],
            correctAnswer: 1,
            explanation: "We use a boolean array of size n+1, where 'true' means a number is prime and 'false' means it has been marked as a multiple."
