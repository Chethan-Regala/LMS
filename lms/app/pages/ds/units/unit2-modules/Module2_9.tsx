        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What is the problem asking?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You are given a list of numbers. Your task is to arrange them in ascending order, meaning from the smallest number to the largest number.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          You are not allowed to use any built-in sorting functions, so you must write the sorting logic yourself.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Why do we need sorting?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Sorting helps us:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Read data more easily</li>
          <li>Search faster</li>
          <li>Organize results in a meaningful way</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">In real life, it's like arranging:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Marks from lowest to highest</li>
          <li>Prices from cheapest to most expensive</li>
          <li>Dates from oldest to newest</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Approach used in this lesson: Bubble Sort</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">We will use Bubble Sort because:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>It is easy to understand</li>
          <li>It works well for learning logic</li>
          <li>It does not use any built-in functions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">How Bubble Sort works (simple explanation)</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Think of numbers as bubbles in water.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>We compare two adjacent numbers</li>
          <li>If the left number is greater, we swap them</li>
          <li>We repeat this process again and again</li>
          <li>After every round, the largest number moves to the end</li>
          <li>We stop when the array becomes fully sorted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Step-by-step idea</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Start from the first element</li>
          <li>Compare it with the next element</li>
          <li>Swap if they are in the wrong order</li>
          <li>Move forward and keep comparing</li>
          <li>Repeat this for multiple rounds until no swaps are needed</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Example walkthrough</h3>
        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Input:</p>
          <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded mb-4">
            <code>5 2 3 1</code>
          </pre>

          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Steps:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Compare 5 and 2 → swap → 2 5 3 1</li>
            <li>Compare 5 and 3 → swap → 2 3 5 1</li>
            <li>Compare 5 and 1 → swap → 2 3 1 5</li>
            <li>Next round continues until sorted</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Final Output:</p>
          <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded">
            <code>1 2 3 5</code>
          </pre>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Important points to remember</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements</li>
          <li>Multiple passes are required</li>
          <li>Duplicate values are handled correctly</li>
          <li>Negative numbers are also sorted properly</li>
          <li>Time complexity is slower, but logic is very clear</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">When should you use this approach?</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>When learning sorting logic</li>
          <li>When problem size is small</li>
          <li>When clarity matters more than performance</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Don't worry if this feels slow at first. Sorting problems help build comparison logic, which is a foundation for many advanced algorithms.

              correctAnswer: 1,
              explanation: "Bubble Sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them."
            },
            {
              question: "After one full pass of Bubble Sort on an array of size 'n', which element is guaranteed to be in its correct sorted position?",
              options: ["The smallest element", "The largest element", "The middle element", "No element is guaranteed after one pass"],
              correctAnswer: 1,
              explanation: "In each pass, the largest unsorted element 'bubbles' up to its correct final position at the end of the array."

              correctAnswer: 2,
              explanation: "In the worst case (reverse sorted array), Bubble Sort needs n passes, each doing nearly n comparisons, resulting in quadratic time."

            {
              question: "Why is Bubble Sort suitable for learning purposes despite its inefficiency?",
              options: ["It is the fastest algorithm", "It uses very little memory", "The logic is straightforward and helps beginners understand comparison-based sorting", "It is used in large-scale databases"],
              correctAnswer: 2,
              explanation: "Its simplicity makes it an excellent first algorithm to learn the basic concept of sorting through comparisons."
