              options: ["They sort the array automatically", "They provide O(1) access to the minimum/maximum element", "They use less memory than arrays", "They convert recursion into loops"],
              correctAnswer: 1,
              explanation: "Max-heaps give immediate access to the largest element, and Min-heaps of size K can track the largest K elements efficiently."
            },

              question: "What is the Time Complexity of building a heap from an array of size 'n'?",

              correctAnswer: 2,
              explanation: "Building a heap (Heapify) using the bottom-up approach takes linear time, O(n)."
            },
            {
              question: "In a Min-Heap used to find the Kth largest element, what does the root represent after processing all elements?",
              options: ["The largest element", "The smallest element in the original array", "The Kth largest element", "The average of all elements"],
              correctAnswer: 2,
              explanation: "In a min-heap of size K, the root is the smallest of the K largest elements, which is the Kth largest element overall."
