        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What Is This?</h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          This session is a fun, interactive competition designed to put your problem-solving skills to the test. Instead of a traditional lecture, you will work in teams to solve a challenge using a specific algorithmic strategy. The main event will be a friendly debate where you defend your team's approach and analyze the trade-offs of others.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Learning Objective</h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The goal of this session is for you to be able to defend different approaches to a problem involving core algorithm concepts. You will practice analyzing a problem, formulating a solution using a specific technique, and articulating its strengths and weaknesses.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Session Outcome</h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          By the end of this session, you will have applied your knowledge of complexity, sorting, and recursion to a practical problem. You will be better able to compare different algorithmic solutions and justify why one might be chosen over another based on factors like efficiency and simplicity.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Challenge</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Your core challenge today is a classic coding problem. It's simple to understand but has several interesting solutions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Given a list of unique numbers and a target number T, your task is to determine if there is a pair of two numbers in the list that adds up exactly to T. You only need to return true or false.
        </p>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Example:</p>
          <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded">
            <code>{`List: [3, 5, 2, 8, 11]
Target T: 10
Result: true (because 2 + 8 = 10)`}</code>
          </pre>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Your Mission</h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          You will be divided into three teams. Each team will be assigned a specific approach to solve the "Two Sum" problem. Your goal is to develop a solution based on your assigned method and prepare to defend it in a debate.
        </p>

        <div className="mb-6 space-y-4">
          <div>
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Team 1: The Brute Force Approach</p>
            <p className="mb-2">Your mission is to use the most direct and straightforward method. Check every possible pair of numbers to see if they sum to the target.</p>
            <p className="italic text-gray-700">Hint: Think about the simplest way you would solve this with a pen and paper. How can you make sure you've checked every single combination?</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Team 2: The Sort &amp; Scan Approach</p>
            <p className="mb-2">Your mission is to find a more efficient way. This involves pre-processing the data. First, sort the list, then use a clever technique to find the pair.</p>
            <p className="italic text-gray-700">Hint: Once the list is sorted, if you pick a number from the beginning and one from the end, can their sum tell you which way to move your pointers?</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">Team 3: The Recursive Search Approach</p>
            <p className="mb-2">Your mission is to solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller, identical sub-problems using recursion. For each number, can you find its "complement" in the rest of the list?</p>
            <p className="italic text-gray-700">Hint: Your recursive function could ask a simple question: "Does the number I need exist in the smaller list that's left over?"</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">The Game Plan</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The entire session will be timed. Stay focused and manage your time well!

          questions={[
            {
              question: "What is the time complexity of the 'Brute Force' Two Sum approach where you check every pair?",
              options: ["O(n)", "O(n log n)", "O(n^2)", "O(1)"],
              correctAnswer: 2,
              explanation: "Checking every pair requires two nested loops, each running 'n' times, leading to O(n^2)."
            },
            {
              question: "If Team 2 uses 'Sort & Scan', what is their overall time complexity?",
              options: ["O(n)", "O(n log n)", "O(n^2)", "O(log n)"],
              correctAnswer: 1,
              explanation: "Sorting the array takes O(n log n), and a single two-pointer pass take O(n). The bottleneck is the sorting step, so it is O(n log n)."
            },
            {
              question: "In algorithm design, what does a 'trade-off' typically refer to?",
              options: ["Changing the data type", "Trading speed for memory or simplicity (and vice versa)", "Deleting code to make it run faster", "Updating the compiler"],
              correctAnswer: 1,
              explanation: "Trade-offs are the choices made between competing priorities like execution time, memory usage, and development ease."
            },
            {
              question: "Which of these is a valid point for defending Brute Force in a debate?",

              correctAnswer: 2,
              explanation: "For very small datasets, Brute Force is extremely easy to write, test, and maintain, even if it's theoretically slower."
