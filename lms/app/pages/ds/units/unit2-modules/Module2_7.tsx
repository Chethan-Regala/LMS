          Ever tried to shuffle the letters of your name just for fun? Like, turning "abc" into "ac", "b", or even ""? (Yes, nothing is something in recursion!)
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Welcome to the magical world of subsequences — where even the absence of a letter is still counted. In this lesson, we'll unravel how recursion helps in finding every possible way to pick and skip elements from a sequence — systematically, smartly, and sometimes even sneakily.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          In this lesson, you will learn about working with subsequences and various patterns that you will come across while working with problems using recursion.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Now imagine solving this systematically with a powerful tool: recursion. How does recursion help us uncover all possible subsequences? Let's find out!
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Power of Recursion in Subsequence Problems</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Let's say you're holding the string "ABC".
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">What are the possible subsequences?</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>A</li>
          <li>B</li>
          <li>C</li>
          <li>AB</li>
          <li>AC</li>
          <li>BC</li>
          <li>ABC</li>
          <li>(and yes, the lonely empty string "" too!)</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          So that's 2³ = 8 subsequences, including the empty one. Why 2³? Because for each character, you have two choices: include it, or skip it.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          And this is where recursion enters like a coding superhero, elegantly branching out into all possible paths. One decision at a time.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Real-Life Analogy 1: Packing for a Trip</h3>
        <div className="mb-6">
          <img src="https://kq-storage.kalvium.community/subsequenceinrecursion.png" alt="Packing for a trip" />
        </div>

        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">Scenario:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">You're going on a short trip. You open your closet and see 3 items:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
          <li>Jacket</li>
          <li>Sunglasses</li>
          <li>Book</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Your task: decide which items to pack. You can take all, none, or any combination of them — but you can't change their order in the list.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">The possible packing combinations?</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Jacket, Sunglasses, Book</li>
          <li>Jacket, Sunglasses</li>
          <li>Jacket, Book</li>
          <li>Jacket</li>
          <li>Sunglasses, Book</li>
          <li>Sunglasses</li>
          <li>Book</li>
          <li>(take nothing and wing it)</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          This is exactly like generating subsequences. For each item, you have a choice: take it or leave it. Recursion simulates this decision-making at each item. It explores all combinations systematically.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Why are subsequences important?</h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          They're foundational for problems like finding subsets, solving combinatorial puzzles, and optimizing operations in dynamic programming.
