        <p className="mb-6">
          Imagine your eyesight focusing on only a few words at a time while reading—that's your window.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          As your eyes move forward, new words come into focus while previous ones fade. When you're tired, your vision narrows; when alert, it expands. For difficult sentences, you refocus on smaller sections before broadening your view again. This natural adjustment mirrors the sliding window technique, ensuring smooth and efficient processing!
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What is the Sliding Window Technique?</h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          The sliding window technique is an efficient method in computer science for optimizing problems involving arrays, strings, and other linear data structures. It transforms certain algorithms with O(n²) time complexity into O(n) solutions by reducing redundant computations. Conceptually, it functions like a window moving over a sequence of data, dynamically expanding or contracting based on specific conditions. This approach enables processing data in segments rather than recalculating values for each individual element, significantly improving efficiency.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Now, let's watch a short video demonstrating the sliding window technique with a simple example.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Types of Sliding Window Techniques</h3>
        <p className="mb-6">
          There are two primary types of sliding window techniques. Let's explore each one, compare their differences in the table below, and then go through the pseudocodes for both.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Fixed-Size Sliding Window</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A fixed-size sliding window maintains a window of constant size (like 3 elements) that moves through an array one element at a time. It's perfect for problems where you need to find optimal subarrays of a specific size.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
          Example Problem: Find max sum of exactly 3 consecutive elements in an array
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Let's use this array: [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">Approach and Dry Run:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We start by calculating the sum of our first window of size 3, then slide through the array, updating our sum and tracking the maximum value.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Initial window: [2, 1, 5] = 8 (This is our current maxSum)</li>
          <li>Slide window: Remove 2, add 1 → [1, 5, 1] = 7 (Less than maxSum, so maxSum stays 8)</li>
          <li>Slide window: Remove 1, add 3 → [5, 1, 3] = 9 (Greater than maxSum, so maxSum becomes 9)</li>
          <li>Slide window: Remove 5, add 2 → [1, 3, 2] = 6 (Less than maxSum, so maxSum stays 9)</li>
          <li>Final answer: 9</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          <strong>How it's efficient:</strong> Instead of recalculating the entire sum for each window (which would be 3 additions each time), we do just 2 operations: 1 subtraction and 1 addition. This makes our algorithm much faster!
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Variable-Size Sliding Window</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A variable-size sliding window can grow or shrink based on conditions. It's used when you don't know the exact size of the subarray you're looking for, but you know a condition it must satisfy.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
          Example Problem: Find smallest subarray with sum ≥ target value (let's say target = 7)
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Let's use this array: [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2]
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">Approach and Dry Run:</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We start with an empty window and expand it by adding elements until we meet our condition. Once the condition is met, we try to shrink the window from the left while still maintaining the condition, recording the best window size along the way.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Start with empty window, currentSum = 0, minLength = infinity</li>
          <li>Add 2: [2], sum = 2 (&lt; 7, condition not met, expand)</li>
          <li>Add 1: [2, 1], sum = 3 (&lt; 7, condition not met, expand)</li>
          <li>Add 5: [2, 1, 5], sum = 8 (≥ 7, condition met!)</li>
          <li>Record length: 3 elements (new minLength = 3)</li>
          <li>Try shrinking: Remove 2, window becomes [1, 5], sum = 6 (&lt; 7, can't shrink more)</li>
          <li>Add 2: [1, 5, 2], sum = 8 (≥ 7, condition met)</li>
          <li>Try shrinking: Remove 1, window becomes [5, 2], sum = 7 (= 7, still meets condition)</li>
          <li>Record length: 2 elements (new minLength = 2)</li>
          <li>Try shrinking more: Remove 5, window becomes [2], sum = 2 (&lt; 7, can't shrink more)</li>
          <li>Add 3: [2, 3], sum = 5 (&lt; 7, condition not met, expand)</li>
          <li>Add 2: [2, 3, 2], sum = 7 (= 7, condition met!)</li>
          <li>Record length: 3 elements (not smaller than minLength = 2)</li>
          <li>Try shrinking: Remove 2, window becomes [3, 2], sum = 5 (&lt; 7, can't shrink more)</li>
          <li>End of array reached</li>
          <li>Final answer: The smallest subarray with sum ≥ 7 has length 2 (the elements [5, 2])</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-6">
          <strong>How it's efficient:</strong> The "expand and shrink" approach ensures we examine each element at most twice (once when adding, once when potentially removing), giving us linear time complexity despite checking subarrays of different sizes.

        <p className="mb-6">
          To summarize, the sliding window technique boosts efficiency by eliminating redundant calculations. Instead of recalculating sums entirely, we update them dynamically by removing the outgoing element and adding the incoming one. This reduces the time complexity from O(n multiplied k) to O(n), (where n is total number of elements and k is the window size) making it highly efficient for large datasets.
