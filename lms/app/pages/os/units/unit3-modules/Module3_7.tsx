  {
    question: "In Problem 1, P1 enters when S1 ≠ S2 and P2 enters when S1 = S2. Why is Progress not guaranteed?",
    options: ["Because mutual exclusion is violated.", "Because if conditions are not met, a process might wait indefinitely even if the critical section is free.", "Because the variables are boolean.", "Because there is no turn-taking variable."],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Progress is only guaranteed if the decision on who enters next is not postponed indefinitely; here, a process might get stuck waiting on a condition that never changes."
  },
  {
    question: "In Problem 3, the use of two 'wants' flags independently can lead to which major synchronization issue?",
    options: ["Memory Leak", "Race Condition on variables", "Deadlock (circular wait)", "CPU Overheating"],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "If both processes set their flags to true at the same exact time, both will enter their while-loops and wait for the other to finish, which never happens."
  },
  {
    question: "A counting semaphore initialized to 10 undergoes 6 P (wait) and 4 V (signal) operations. What is the final value?",
    options: ["0", "8", "12", "14"],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Calculated as: 10 - 6 + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary purpose of the 'Bounded Waiting' condition?",
    options: ["To speed up the CPU clock.", "To ensure that no process is starved of the resource indefinitely.", "To limit the number of threads in the system.", "To ensure the monitor is always active."],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Bounded waiting ensures that once a process makes a request, there is a limit on how many others can bypass it, preventing starvation."
  },
  {
    question: "Priority Inversion happens when:",
    options: ["A high-priority process is waiting for a resource held by a low-priority process.", "The OS reassigns priorities randomly.", "Two processes have the same priority.", "A process finishes its task early."],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: "This is problematic because the high-priority task is effectively blocked by the low-priority one, which might itself be preempted by middle-priority tasks."

        <p>To answer this, we explore Process Synchronization Problems practical scenarios that test how synchronization primitives like semaphores, mutexes, and monitors work together to maintain control, order, and fairness among processes.</p>
        <p>In this lesson, you will explore various problems related to process synchronization and understand how synchronization primitives such as semaphores, mutexes, and monitors are applied in real scenarios.</p>

        <h3>Problem 1</h3>
        <p>Consider the methods used by processes P1 and P2 for accessing their critical sections. The initial values of shared boolean variables S1 and S2 are randomly assigned.</p>

          <li>(c) Neither mutual exclusion nor progress</li>
          <li>(d) Both mutual exclusion and progress</li>

          <p className="mt-2">P1 and P2 depend on conditions involving S1 and S2 to access their critical sections.</p>
          <p className="mt-2"><strong>Mutual Exclusion:</strong></p>

            <li>P1 enters if S1 ≠ S2 and P2 enters if S1 = S2.</li>

        <p>Watch the following video to understand how processes use synchronization constructs like semaphores to control access to shared resources.</p>

        <h3>Problem 3</h3>
        <p>Two processes, P1 and P2, need to access a critical section of code. Consider the synchronization construct used by the processes:</p>

            <li><strong>Deadlock:</strong> Both may set wants = true simultaneously → both wait forever → deadlock possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Bounded Waiting:</strong> Not guaranteed — one process can be delayed indefinitely.</li>

        <h3>Concept Recap</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Semaphores manage signaling between processes and prevent race conditions.</li>
          <li>Mutexes ensure mutual exclusion for accessing shared resources.</li>
          <li>Monitors provide structured synchronization with automatic mutual exclusion and condition variables.</li>
          <li>Deadlocks and starvation must be checked in every synchronization design.</li>
        </ul>

          <summary className="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Practice Question</summary>
          <p className="mt-2">A semaphore S is initialized to 5. Process A performs 3 P (wait) operations, and Process B performs 2 V (signal) operations. What will be the final value of the semaphore? Show your calculation.</p>
          <p className="mt-2 font-semibold">Answer</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Initial S = 5</li>
            <li>After 3 P → 5 − 3 = 2</li>
            <li>After 2 V → 2 + 2 = 4</li>

        <h3>Additional Practice Problems (No solutions; use as assignments)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Producer-Consumer Variation:</strong> A buffer of size 4 is shared between one producer and one consumer. The producer produces items at rates that sometimes exceed the consumer. Design a semaphore-based solution (list semaphores and initial values) and explain how you would prevent buffer overflow and underflow. Also describe what happens if the producer crashes while holding the mutex.</li>
          <li><strong>Readers–Writers (Writers Priority):</strong> Design a monitor or semaphore solution that gives priority to writers but prevents starvation of readers. Describe the variables you will keep, the order of operations for readers and writers, and how you guarantee no starvation.</li>
          <li><strong>Dining Philosophers Extension:</strong> Suppose 7 philosophers sit around a circular table. Propose two different solutions (one using resource ordering and another using a monitor) that avoid deadlock. For each solution, argue correctness and whether starvation can still occur.</li>
          <li><strong>Barrier Synchronization:</strong> N threads perform computations in phases. Implement a barrier so that no thread proceeds to the next phase until all N threads finish the current phase. Provide a semaphore/monitor-based design and explain how to reuse the barrier across multiple phases.</li>
          <li><strong>Bounded Waiting Test:</strong> Consider a mutual-exclusion algorithm where each process uses a shared variable turn and a flag array. Prove or provide a counterexample whether this algorithm guarantees bounded waiting. If not, show how to modify it to enforce bounded waiting.</li>
          <li><strong>Priority Inversion Scenario:</strong> Describe a system with three threads (low, medium, high priority) and a shared resource protected by a mutex. Show how priority inversion can occur and propose at least two strategies (e.g., priority inheritance, priority ceiling) to mitigate it. Explain trade-offs for each strategy.</li>
