          Have you ever wondered how your computer can play music, browse the web,
          and download a file all at the same time?</p>
        <p> This magic is possible because
          of processes and threads. They are the real heroes behind multitasking
          and efficient resource management in every operating system.

          In this lesson, you’ll explore the fundamental concepts of processes
          and threads, which are the backbone of multitasking and resource
          management in an operating system. You will also explore what
          processes are, how they are created, their lifecycle, and the
          different states a process can be in during execution.

        <h3>Processes and Threads</h3>

        <p>
          In an operating system, a process is a program that is currently being
          executed. It is more than just a running program; it includes the
          program code, its current activity, and the resources it uses, such as
          memory and CPU time. A process is created when a program is executed
          and exists until it finishes or is terminated.
        </p>

        <img src="https://kq-storage.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Operating+Systems/os_process_threads.png" alt="" />

        <p>
          A thread is the smallest unit of CPU execution within a process. While
          a process can contain multiple threads, all threads share the same
          memory and resources, making them lighter and faster to switch between
          compared to separate processes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Threads are essential for concurrent programming allowing multiple
          operations to happen “in parallel” within the same application.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> In a browser, one thread may load the page,
          another may handle user input, and another may stream audio, all under
          the same process.

        <h3>Process State</h3>

        <p>
          In an operating system, a process goes through various stages during its lifetime, and these stages are referred to as process states. A process can be in one of several states at any given point, depending on its activity and the resources available to it. Understanding these states helps us comprehend how the operating system manages and transitions processes efficiently.

          The Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure used by the operating system to store information about each active process.

      {/* Scheduling */}
      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>Process Scheduling</h3>

        <p>
          Process scheduling is an essential function of an operating system (OS) that determines which process runs at any given time. The goal is to ensure fair and efficient use of the CPU while managing multiple processes. To understand process scheduling better, it's important to know about two main components:
        </p>
        <img src="https://kq-storage.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Operating%2BSystems/scheduling_queues.webp" alt="" />
        <p>Process scheduling determines which process gets the CPU next.
          It ensures that all processes get a fair share of CPU time, maintaining smooth multitasking.


          The operating system uses multiple queues to manage processes at different stages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job Queue :  All processes that are waiting to be admitted into the system.</li>
          <li>Ready Queue : Processes that are ready and waiting for CPU time.</li>
          <li>I/O Queue : Processes performing input/output operations before returning to ready state.</li>
          <li>Exit : Processes that have completed execution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s visualize how a process moves through these queues:</p>

        {/* Animation */}
        <div className="queue-wrapper">
          {queue.map((q, i) => (
            <div
              key={q}
              className={`queue-box ${step === i ? 'active' : ''}`}
            >
              {q}
              {step === i && <div className="p1">P1</div>}
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>

        <p>
          Watch how the process (P1) moves from the Job Queue → Ready Queue → CPU
          → I/O Queue → Exit and loops back,demonstrating the continuous scheduling cycle.
        </p>

        <p>
          This animation illustrates how the CPU scheduler ensures efficient and orderly execution of processes.
          Each movement represents how the OS decides when a process should run, wait, or perform I/O ensuring maximum CPU utilization and fairness among all active processes.


          In real systems, scheduling algorithms like FCFS, Round Robin, Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling determine this order dynamically, balancing speed, responsiveness, and resource fairness.

            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>

              <li>Complex debugging:<br /><small>Managing multiple threads can lead to synchronization issues and race conditions.</small></li>
              <li>Context switching overhead:<br /><small>Switching between processes/threads consumes CPU time and memory.</small></li>
              <li>Resource contention:<br /><small> Threads competing for shared data may cause inconsistent results</small></li>
              <li>Deadlocks:<br /><small>Poor synchronization can cause processes to wait indefinitely for each other’s resources.</small></li>

          <h4>💡 Real-World Scenario</h4>
          <p>
            Imagine you’re watching a YouTube video:
            <br /> One process runs your
            browser. <br />Inside it, multiple threads handle different tasks — one decodes the video, another manages buffering, another plays the audio, and another listens for your clicks.
            <br />When you open a new tab or download something, the OS uses process scheduling to allocate CPU time fairly among them.
            <br />If your network is slow, the I/O thread moves to a waiting state while others continue working — keeping playback smooth.

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Processes and Threads:</strong> A process is a program in execution,
            while a thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process. Threads
            allow tasks to be divided and executed concurrently within the same process,
            improving efficiency.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Process State:</strong> A process transitions through states such as
            new, ready, running, waiting, and terminated during its lifecycle. These
            states represent the different stages of execution and interaction with
            system resources.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Process Control Block (PCB):</strong> The PCB acts as a data structure
            that holds essential information about a process, such as its state, program
            counter, CPU registers, memory limits, and I/O status, enabling efficient
            process management by the OS.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Process Scheduling:</strong> This mechanism ensures optimal CPU
            utilization by organizing processes using structures like the job queue and
            ready queue. It prioritizes and allocates CPU time to processes based on
            scheduling algorithms to meet system performance goals.
