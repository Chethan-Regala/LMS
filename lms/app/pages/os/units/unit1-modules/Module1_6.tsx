        <p>
          In this lesson, you will explore the fundamentals of operating system
          (OS) design and implementation. We will examine how operating systems
          are planned, structured, and realized in practice. This lesson also
          discusses the core objectives, policies, mechanisms, and architectural
          structures that define how modern OS function and evolve.

        <p>
          You will understand how designers translate theoretical concepts into
          real, efficient systems that manage both hardware and software
          resources. This knowledge will give you insight into how OS design
          choices affect system performance, security, scalability, and
          usability.

      {/* OS Design & Implementation */}
      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>Operating System Design &amp; Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          Operating system design involves structuring and organizing system
          components to meet objectives such as reliability, performance,
          security, scalability, and maintainability.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Implementation Focus */}
      <section className="content-section">
        <h4>Implementation Focus</h4>
        <p>
          The focus of implementation is to convert the design into working code
          that interacts directly with hardware components and user-level
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          It includes writing the kernel, developing system calls, integrating
          device drivers, and managing input/output subsystems. Proper
          implementation ensures the OS can efficiently manage resources such as
          CPU time, memory, and peripheral devices.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Policies & Mechanisms */}
      <section className="content-section">
        <h4>Policies &amp; Mechanisms</h4>
        <p>
          OS mechanisms define how tasks are executed, while policies determine
          what should be done. For example, a scheduling mechanism determines
          how processes switch, and a scheduling policy decides which process
          runs next.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mechanisms provide flexibility, allowing policies to be changed or
          optimized without altering the system’s core logic.

        <h3>Design Goals of a Real-Time OS vs General-Purpose OS</h3>
        <p>
          The design goals of a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) focus on
          deterministic behavior, ensuring that critical tasks meet their
          deadlines consistently and reliably. Timing, predictability, and low
          latency are crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, a General-Purpose Operating System (GPOS) emphasizes
          throughput, multitasking, and usability, focusing on performance and
          flexibility rather than strict timing guarantees.

        <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>

        <h3>Structures of an Operating System</h3>
        <p>
          The structure of an operating system defines how its core components
          are organized, interact, and exchange data.</p>
        <p>Different structures were
          developed to overcome challenges like system complexity, maintenance,
          performance, and security.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below are the three fundamental architectures that have shaped how
          modern operating systems are built today.

      </section>

      {/* Monolithic */}
      <section className="content-section">
        <h4>Monolithic Structure</h4>
        <p>
          In a Monolithic Operating System, all services such as process
          management, file handling, device drivers, and memory management exist
          together in one large kernel space. Since everything shares the same
          memory, the system runs very fast, but it becomes fragile because a
          bug in one service can crash the entire OS.
        </p>

        <h5>Advantages</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Very high performance due to direct function calls.</li>
          <li>Efficient resource sharing between components.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Hard to maintain and extend.</li>
          <li>
            Low security and poor fault isolation — one fault can stop the
            system.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Examples:</strong> UNIX, MS-DOS, early Linux versions.
        </p>
        <p className="bg-yellow-50 p-3 rounded-lg text-yellow-800">
          💡 Like an open workspace where everyone talks freely — work happens
          fast but one problem affects the entire team.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Layered */}
      <section className="content-section">
        <h4>Layered Structure</h4>
        <p>
          In this model, the OS is divided into multiple layers, each with a
          defined role and dependency on the layer below it. The top layers
          provide user services, while the lower layers handle hardware-level
          functions. This makes the design clean, modular, and easy to debug.
        </p>

        <h5>Advantages</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear separation of system functionality.</li>
          <li>Easier to maintain and test.</li>
          <li>Errors are isolated within layers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Some loss in speed due to crossing multiple layers.</li>
          <li>Difficult to define perfect layer boundaries.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Examples:</strong> THE Operating System, Windows NT (partially
          layered).
        </p>
        <p className="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded-lg text-blue-800">
          💡 Like an office building with separate departments on each floor —
          communication is structured and controlled.
        </p>
      </section>

      {/* Microkernel */}
      <section className="content-section">
        <h4>Microkernel Structure</h4>
        <p>
          In a Microkernel OS, only essential functions such as inter-process
          communication (IPC), CPU scheduling, and memory management run inside
          the kernel. All other services like drivers, file systems, and network
          protocols run in user mode.
        </p>

        <p>
          This separation enhances <strong>security, stability, and
            modularity</strong>, as faults in user-space services do not crash the
          core kernel.
        </p>

        <h5>Advantages</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Very high modularity and fault tolerance.</li>
          <li>Easier updates and system extensions.</li>
          <li>Improved security as kernel remains small.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Slight performance overhead due to message passing.</li>
          <li>More complex communication design.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Examples:</strong> Mach, QNX, Minix, macOS (XNU hybrid kernel).
        </p>
        <p className="bg-green-50 p-3 rounded-lg text-green-800">
          💡 Like a secure core office where only key employees work inside, and

          title="Module 1.6 Quiz: OS Design and Structures"
          questions={[
            {
              question: "What is the difference between an OS mechanism and an OS policy?",
              options: ["Mechanism determines WHAT to do, policy determines HOW to do it", "Mechanism determines HOW to do something, policy determines WHAT will be done", "They are the same thing", "Mechanism is for users, policy is for developers"],
              correctAnswer: 1,
              explanation: "Mechanisms (the 'how') provide the tools, while policies (the 'what') decide how to use those tools. Separating them allows for greater flexibility."
            },
            {
              question: "In which OS structure do all services like file handling and device drivers run together in a single large kernel space?",
              options: ["Layered Structure", "Microkernel Structure", "Monolithic Structure", "Hybrid Structure"],
              correctAnswer: 2,
              explanation: "A monolithic kernel includes all OS services in one large program, which offers high performance but is harder to maintain."
            },
            {
              question: "What is a major advantage of the Microkernel structure?",
              options: ["Highest possible performance", "Simplicity of design", "Enhanced security and stability because services run in user mode", "No need for inter-process communication"],
              correctAnswer: 2,
              explanation: "By running only essential services in the kernel and others in user mode, a failure in a service (like a driver) won't crash the whole system."
            },
            {
              question: "Which type of OS prioritizes deterministic behavior and strict timing guarantees?",
              options: ["General-Purpose OS (GPOS)", "Real-Time OS (RTOS)", "Mobile OS", "Batch OS"],
              correctAnswer: 1,
              explanation: "RTOS is designed for time-critical systems where predictability and meeting deadlines are the most important goals."
            },
            {
              question: "The 'Layered Structure' makes an OS easier to debug because:",
              options: ["It is the fastest structure", "It doesn't use a kernel", "Errors are isolated within specific layers", "It only has one layer"],
              correctAnswer: 2,
              explanation: "In a layered approach, each layer only uses functions of the layer below it, making it easier to identify where an error is occurring."
