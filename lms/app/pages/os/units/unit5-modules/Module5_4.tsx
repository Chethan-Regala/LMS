        <p>
          Files on your computer are like little residents looking for their homes on the disk. How do they find the right blocks? Let's see how the operating system interestingly allocates them. Our curious cat will guide us through the world of file allocation!

        <h3>File Allocation Methods</h3>
        <p>
          The allocation method defines how the files are stored in the disk blocks. The direct access nature of the disks gives us the flexibility to implement the files. In many cases, different files or many files are stored on the same disk. The main problem that occurs in the operating system is that how we allocate the spaces to these files so that the utilization of disk is efficient and the quick access to the file is possible.

        <h3>Three Main Methods</h3>
        <p>There are mainly three methods of file allocation in the disk. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Mainly a system uses one method for all files within the system.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contiguous allocation</li>
          <li>Linked allocation</li>
          <li>Indexed allocation</li>

        <p>The main idea behind these methods is to provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Efficient disk space utilization.</li>
          <li>Fast access to the file blocks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The allocation method defines how files are stored on disk blocks. Efficient allocation ensures fast access and optimal disk usage.</p>

        <h3>Contiguous Allocation</h3>
        <p>
          Each file occupies a contiguous set of blocks on the disk. For example, if a file requires n blocks and is given a block b as the starting location, then the blocks assigned to the file will be: b, b+1, b+2,……b+n-1. This means that given the starting block address and the length of the file (in terms of blocks required), we can determine the blocks occupied by the file. The directory entry for a file with contiguous allocation contains:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Address of starting block</li>
          <li>Length of the allocated portion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Image credits: geeksforgeeks</p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The file 'mail' in the above image starts from the block 19 with length = 6 blocks. Therefore, it occupies 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 blocks.
        </p>
        <ContiguousAnimation />

        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Supports both Sequential and Direct Access.</li>
          <li>Direct access is fast, as the address of the k-th block is (b + k).</li>
          <li>Minimal seeks due to contiguous allocation, ensuring high speed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Suffers from internal and external fragmentation, reducing memory efficiency.</li>
          <li>Expanding a file is difficult as it requires contiguous free space.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>Linked Allocation</h3>
        <p>
          Each file is a linked list of disk blocks which need not be contiguous. The disk blocks can be scattered anywhere on the disk. The directory entry contains a pointer to the starting file block. Each block contains a pointer to the next block occupied by the file.
        </p>
        <div className="flex justify-center my-4">
          <img src="https://kq-storage.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Operating%2BSystems/os_files8.png" alt="Linked Allocation" className="rounded-lg shadow-lg max-w-lg" />

        <p className="mt-2">
          The file 'jeep' in the above image shows how the blocks are randomly distributed. The last block (25) contains -1 indicating a null pointer and does not point to any other block.
        </p>
        <LinkedAnimation />

        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Flexible file size—files can grow easily without needing contiguous memory.</li>
          <li>No external fragmentation, leading to better memory utilization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Slower access due to multiple seeks for scattered blocks.</li>
          <li>No direct access—A block k of a file can be accessed by traversing k blocks sequentially (sequential access) from the starting block of the file via block pointers.</li>
          <li>Extra overhead due to storage of block pointers.</li>
        </ul>

      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>Indexed Allocation</h3>
        <p>
          In this method, a special block known as the Index block contains the pointers to all the blocks occupied by a file. Each file has its own index block. The i-th entry in the index block contains the disk address of the i-th file block. The directory entry contains the address of the index block as shown in the image:
        </p>

        </div>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Image credits: geeksforgeeks</p>
        <IndexedAnimation />

        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Supports direct access, enabling fast file retrieval.</li>
          <li>Eliminates external fragmentation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Higher pointer overhead compared to linked allocation.</li>
          <li>Inefficient for small files, as an entire index block is used even for a few blocks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>Handling Large Files in Indexed Allocation</h3>
        <p>To handle larger files, additional techniques are used to extend indexed allocation. Let's explore them.</p>
        <p>When a single index block cannot hold all pointers for a large file, the following techniques are used:</p>

        <h4>1. Linked Scheme</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This scheme links two or more index blocks together for holding the pointers.</li>
          <li>Every index block would then contain a pointer or the address to the next index block.</li>
          <li>This helps extend file storage dynamically without requiring a large contiguous index block.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Multilevel Index</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In this, a first level index block is used to point to the second level index blocks which in turn points to the disk blocks occupied by the file.</li>
          <li>This can be extended to 3 or more levels depending on the maximum file size.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Combined Scheme (Inode-Based Allocation)</h4>
        <p>
          A special structure called Inode (Information Node) stores file details and block addresses. The Inode contains direct pointers to file data blocks and indirect pointers for larger files. Indirect blocks may be single indirect, double indirect or triple indirect.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single Indirect:</strong> Stores addresses of blocks containing file data.</li>
          <li><strong>Double Indirect:</strong> Points to blocks that store addresses of data blocks.</li>
          <li><strong>Triple Indirect:</strong> Points to blocks that store addresses of second-level index blocks.</li>
        </ul>
