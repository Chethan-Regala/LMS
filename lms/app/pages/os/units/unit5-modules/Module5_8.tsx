        <h3>What Does 'Virtual' Mean?</h3>
        <p>Let's take a step back—what exactly does 'virtual' mean?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Virtual</strong> means something that exists in a digital or simulated environment rather than physically. It behaves like the real thing but is not physically present.

        <h3>What is a Virtual Machine?</h3>
        <p>
          A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based computer that runs inside a physical computer. It behaves like a real computer, with its own operating system, memory, storage, and applications, but it doesn't physically exist—it's completely virtual!

        <h3>Types of Hypervisor</h3>
        <p>Now that we understand what a Virtual Machine is and how it works, let's explore the key component that makes virtualization possible—the hypervisor!</p>
        <p>Before exploring the types of hypervisors, let's first understand what a hypervisor is🖥️</p>

            A <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a software that creates and manages Virtual Machines (VMs) by allocating resources like CPU, RAM, and storage from the host system.

        <p>There are two types of hypervisor, namely:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Type 1 hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor)</li>
          <li>Type 2 hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor)</li>

      </section>

      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the physical hardware without requiring a host operating system.</li>
          <li>It provides better performance, stability, and security because it has direct access to hardware resources.</li>
          <li>This type of hypervisor is used in enterprise environments, data centers, and cloud computing.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> VMware vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Citrix XenServer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Use case:</strong> A cloud service provider, such as AWS or Microsoft Azure, deploys Type 1 hypervisors on powerful physical servers in data centers. These hypervisors run directly on the hardware, allowing multiple virtual machines to operate efficiently with dedicated resources.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="content-section">
        <h3>Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A Type 2 hypervisor runs on top of an existing operating system, functioning like an application.</li>
          <li>It is easier to set up but slightly less efficient because it relies on the host operating system for resource management.</li>
          <li>This type of hypervisor is suitable for personal use, software testing, and development.</li>
          <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels Desktop.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Use case:</strong> A software developer working on cross-platform applications installs a Type 2 hypervisor, such as VirtualBox or VMware Workstation, on their Windows laptop. They create a Linux virtual machine to test applications in a different operating system without affecting their primary OS.

        <h3>Working of a Virtual Machine</h3>
        <p>Let's explore how a virtual machine works.</p>
        <p>Check out the image for a clear and concise visual of how it works!</p>

        </div>
        <p>Virtual Machines (VMs) run inside a physical computer (host machine) using virtualization technology.</p>

        <h4>Physical Hardware (Host Machine)</h4>
        <p>The actual computer (server, PC, or cloud machine) provides CPU, RAM, storage, and network resources.</p>

        <h4>Hypervisor (Virtualization Software)</h4>
        <p>The hypervisor is a special software layer that creates and manages multiple Virtual Machines on the host machine. It allocates resources like CPU, memory, and storage to each VM.</p>

        <h4>Virtual Machine (Guest OS)</h4>
        <p>Each VM runs its own operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.) inside the host machine. The guest OS thinks it is running on a real computer, but it's actually virtual.</p>

        <h4>Resource Allocation & Isolation</h4>
        <p>The hypervisor divides and allocates host machine resources (CPU, RAM, storage) among VMs. Each VM runs independently, so if one VM crashes or gets infected by a virus, others remain safe.</p>

        <h4>Running Applications & Workloads</h4>
        <p>Once set up, VMs function just like a normal computer, running software, hosting servers, or testing applications.</p>

            <li><strong>Hypervisor (Building Manager)</strong> → Manages resource distribution to each VM.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilities (CPU, RAM, Storage)</strong> → Shared among all apartments (VMs).</li>
            <li><strong>If One Apartment Has Issues</strong> like a broken pipe in one apartment doesn't affect others—just like a VM crash won't harm the host or other VMs.</li>

        <h3>Types of Virtual Machines</h3>

        <h4>System Virtual Machine</h4>
        <p>Think of this as creating a whole new computer inside your existing one.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It allows you to run an entire operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) on a single physical machine.</li>
          <li>Uses a hypervisor to manage multiple virtual machines on the same hardware.</li>
          <li>Each VM runs independently, as if it were a separate physical computer.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Used in cloud computing, server management, and software testing.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> Running Windows inside a Mac using VirtualBox</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 italic">VirtualBox is a free, open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle that allows users to create and run Virtual Machines (VMs) on their computers.</p>

        <h4>Process Virtual Machine</h4>
        <p>Instead of running an entire OS, this type of VM is designed to run a single application or process.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It creates a virtual environment that allows apps to run across different operating systems.</li>
          <li>The host OS remains the same, but the app runs inside a virtual runtime environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Used for software portability, app compatibility, and cross-platform development.</li>
          <li><strong>Example:</strong> Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows Java programs to run on Windows, Linux, and Mac without modification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What are Containers?</h3>
        <p>Now that we've seen how VMs create isolated environments, what if we could achieve isolation without running an entire OS? This is where containers come in. Let's explore!</p>
        <p>
          Containers are lightweight, portable environments that allow applications to run consistently across different computing environments. Unlike virtual machines, which virtualize hardware, containers virtualize the operating system, enabling faster performance and better resource efficiency.
        </p>
        <div className="border-4 border-cyan-500 bg-cyan-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
          <p className="text-cyan-800">
            Let's take it this way, think of containers like food delivery meal kits. Each kit comes with pre-measured ingredients and instructions, so you can cook a meal without worrying about shopping or preparation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-cyan-800 mt-2">
            Similarly, a container includes everything an application needs—code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies—so it can run quickly and consistently anywhere, without worrying about the underlying system.
          </p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <ContainerAnimation />
