      options: ["Pick the one with the longer burst time.", "Pick the one with the shorter burst time.", "Pick the one with the larger process ID.", "Wait for a third process to arrive."],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "If arrival times are equal, SJF prioritizes the process with the shortest burst time to minimize overall waiting time."

      question: "What is the formula for calculating 'Waiting Time (WT)' in CPU scheduling?",
      options: ["Burst Time - Arrival Time", "Turnaround Time (TAT) - Burst Time (BT)", "Completion Time - Burst Time", "Turnaround Time + Arrival Time"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Waiting Time is the amount of time a process sits in the ready queue, calculated as TAT minus the time it actually spent executing (BT)."

      question: "How do you calculate 'Average Turnaround Time' for a set of processes?",

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Average Turnaround Time is the arithmetic mean of all individual turnaround times."

      question: "What is the main advantage of implementing SJF over FCFS?",
      options: ["It is easier to code.", "It minimizes the average waiting time for a given set of processes.", "It eliminates the possibility of starvation.", "It doesn't require knowing burst times."],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "SJF is the most efficient algorithm in terms of minimizing the average wait time for all processes."

      question: "Which time metric represents when a process finishes its execution?",
      options: ["Arrival Time", "Burst Time", "Completion Time", "Turnaround Time"],

      <section className="content-section">
        <p>In this assignment, you will be implementing Shortest Job First Algorithm (SJF) — one of the most efficient CPU scheduling techniques in Operating Systems.</p>
        <p>The Shortest Job First (SJF) or Shortest Job Next (SJN) algorithm selects the waiting process that has the smallest execution time to execute next. SJF (or SJN) can be preemptive or non-preemptive, depending on whether a running process can be interrupted for a new, shorter one.</p>

          <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 rounded">
            <h4 className="font-semibold">1. Turnaround Time (TAT):</h4>
            <p><strong>TAT = Completion Time (CT) − Arrival Time (AT)</strong></p>
            <p>Represents the total time a process spends in the system, from arrival to completion.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-500 p-4 rounded">
            <h4 className="font-semibold">2. Waiting Time (WT):</h4>
            <p><strong>WT = Turnaround Time (TAT) − Burst Time (BT)</strong></p>
            <p>The amount of time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before execution.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-500 p-4 rounded">
            <h4 className="font-semibold">3. Completion Time (CT):</h4>
            <p>The time at which a process finishes execution, based on burst times and order of execution.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 rounded">
            <h4 className="font-semibold">4. Average Turnaround Time (Avg TAT):</h4>
            <p><strong>Avg TAT = (Sum of Turnaround Times) / (Total Number of Processes)</strong></p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-500 p-4 rounded">
            <h4 className="font-semibold">5. Average Waiting Time (Avg WT):</h4>
            <p><strong>Avg WT = (Sum of Waiting Times) / (Total Number of Processes)</strong></p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>These formulas apply to both preemptive and non-preemptive SJF. The only difference lies in how processes are selected during execution.</p>
