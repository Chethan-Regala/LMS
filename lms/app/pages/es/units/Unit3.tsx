              <div className="theory-box">
                <p>Hey future engineers!  Think of biodiversity as nature's massive distributed database system - it's got three levels of organization, each more complex than the last. Just like how your code has different layers (functions, classes, modules), biodiversity has genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. And trust me, this "database" is way more sophisticated than anything we've built! </p>

                <div className="performance-metrics">
                  <h4>Biodiversity Stats That'll Blow Your Mind </h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total Species:</strong> 8-10 million estimated (we've only cataloged 1.2 million!)</li>
                    <li><strong>Genetic Diversity:</strong> Humans share 99.9% DNA but that 0.1% creates all our differences</li>

              <h4>The Three Levels of Biodiversity </h4>
              <p>Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth and the natural patterns it forms. It encompasses three main levels of biological organization that are interconnected and essential for ecosystem functioning.</p>

              <h5>Genetic Diversity - The Source Code Level </h5>
              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Think of genetic diversity as different versions of the same software - same basic function, but with unique features and capabilities!</p>
                <ul>

              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Species diversity is like having different apps on your phone - each one specialized for specific tasks, but they all work together in the ecosystem!</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Species richness:</strong> Total number of different species (like counting apps)</li>
                  <li><strong>Species evenness:</strong> How evenly distributed the populations are</li>
                  <li><strong>Functional roles:</strong> Each species has specific "jobs" in the ecosystem</li>
                  <li><strong>Species interactions:</strong> How different species "communicate" and depend on each other</li>

              <div className="example-box">
                <p>Ecosystem diversity is like having different operating systems - each optimized for different environments and conditions!</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Habitat variety:</strong> Different "platforms" where life operates</li>
                  <li><strong>Ecological communities:</strong> Groups of species that work together</li>
                  <li><strong>System types:</strong> Marine, freshwater, terrestrial - like different network architectures</li>
                  <li><strong>Complex interactions:</strong> Food webs, nutrient cycles, energy flows</li>
                  <li><strong>Process diversity:</strong> Different ways ecosystems function and maintain themselves</li>

              <div className="theory-box">
                <p>Think of biodiversity distribution like network architecture - you've got global infrastructure, national networks, and local nodes, each with different characteristics and challenges! 🌐 Just like how internet traffic isn't evenly distributed (some servers get way more hits), biodiversity isn't spread evenly across the planet. Some places are like biological data centers - packed with incredible diversity!</p>

                <div className="performance-metrics">
                  <h4>Biodiversity Distribution Facts </h4>
                  <ul>

              <div className="theory-box">
                <p>Conservation is like system backup and disaster recovery - we need both on-site protection (in-situ) and off-site backups (ex-situ) to ensure biodiversity survives! Just like you wouldn't trust a single backup strategy for critical data, we can't rely on just one conservation approach.</p>
