              <div className="theory-box">
                <p>Hey future engineers! Think of population growth like user growth on a platform - it starts slow, then suddenly explodes! Just like how Instagram went from 0 to 2 billion users, human population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to over 8 billion today. Understanding population dynamics is crucial because more users (people) mean more demand for resources, infrastructure, and... well, everything you'll be designing!</p>
